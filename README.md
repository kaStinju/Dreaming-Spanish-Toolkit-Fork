# Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit

## About The Project
* I taught myself some JS with the Odin Project but stopped using it for a while, so I'm making this to try and code a little bit again
* A chrome extension to enable new functionalities on the Dreaming Spanish website

## Chrome Extension
* [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/spruce04/Dreaming-Spanish-Toolkit/tree/main/chrome-extension) &rarr; A chrome extension that has the functionalities of all the currently completed features for easy use
  * Monthly stats calculator
  * Toggle dark mode
* If the extension doesn't work when it first loads, try refreshing the page and reopening the extension (not sure why this happens)

## Possible Future Ideas
* Fix the dark mode display for comments - unsure why this isn't working
* Hide videos functionality
* Any suggestions or bug reports welcome - sam.dev00004@gmail.com
